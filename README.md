# BasicAuthentication in asp.nte

Two Controller: Home and Admin

Public can access Home without Login

To accesss Admin a user must have to be logged in.
Otherwise he/she will be redirected to Login page.

I have used static username=admin and password=123 and Authorize attribute to log in into the system.


Thank you :)
